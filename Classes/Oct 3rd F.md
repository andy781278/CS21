[[Sum Identity]]

How many n length binary start with 1 or end with 00

union start with 1 and end with 00

1,X,...
   n-1 length
2^n-1 size
end with 00 means 2^n-2 probably then
and both of them together is 1, X, ..., X, 0, 0
so 2^n-1 + 2^n-2 - 2^n-3 is the size

len 6, possibilities 0-9

A: begin even (0 2 4 6 8)
B: end 0
C: <5 (only has 4 3 2 1 0)

A + B + C - AinterB - AinterC - BinterC + AinterBinterC
$5*10^5 + 10^5 + 5^6 - 5*10^4*1 - 3*5^5 - 5^5*1 + 3*5^4*1$
