Lecture 1:

- This course explores different mathematical concepts used in CS
    
- Trees are math structures
    
- Counting
    

- [[Product Rule]]
    

- For any sets A and B, |AxB| = |A||B|
    
- AND
    

- [[Sum Rule]]
    

- For disjoint sets A and B, |AUB| = |A|+|B|
    
- OR
    

- [[Power Rule]]
    

- For any set A, |AxAxA….| = |A|^n
    
- For counting num len of strings
    
- Binary strings length n has 2^n possible strings
    
- N is number of slots, A is possible choices per slot
    
- Link this to strings over an alphabet
    
- 26^4
    
- 62^8
    
- 26^8+26^8+10^8
    
- 26*62^7
